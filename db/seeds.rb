# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# post = Post.create(
#   title: "Nevada Falls",
#   longitude: 32.3456,
#   latitude: -112.4321,
#   body: '123456789',
#   location: 'Yosemite'
# )
# post.images.attach(
#   io: File.open('app/javascript/packs/images/pearlake.jpg'),
#   filename: 'pearlake.jpg'
# )
# post.save!
